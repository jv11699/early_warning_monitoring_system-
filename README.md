# Promises and Pitfalls of a New Early Warning System for Gentrification in Buffalo, NY

Gentrification and displacement are two of the many wicked problems of social policy. The study of gentrification and displacement spans half a century, concerns a variety of spatial, temporal, and social contexts, and describes socio-political processes across the globe and throughout history. 
One current iteration of this field of inquiry are efforts to identify early indicators of gentrification and/or displacement via the creation of ``early warning systems'' (EWS). The current work adds to scholarship on the utility of developing an EWS by examining the methodological considerations
required for such systems. Specifically, we 1) outline four major decision points that arise in the construction of EWS, 2) propose a new, theoretically motivated EWS and 3) evaluate it on data from the city of Buffalo, NY. Our work provides a new perspective on the conditions under which EWS are, and are 
not, useful in service of a justice-oriented preventative role.

This repository explores such steps taken.
